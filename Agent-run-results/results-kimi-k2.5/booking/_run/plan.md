# UXAgent Exploration Plan

## Goal

Explore and critique the UX of the full booking system, prioritizing the primary checkout/booking flow (home → city list → area filters → detail → room → booking → confirmation) plus adjacent pages, states, and recovery paths.

## Plan Summary

The exploration will proceed in phases: starting with the home page to validate the search flow, then moving to city/area lists to test filtering, followed by hotel detail and room selection, then booking and confirmation. Adjacent flows (flights, car rentals, attractions) will be sampled, and mobile viewport checks will repeat critical interactions.

## Coverage Targets

- pages: `Visit all known HTML pages (index, tokyo, shinjuku, hotel-detail, room-selection, reservation, confirmation, flights, car-rentals, attractions, help, my-trips).`
- features: `Exercise most visible controls (search, filters, forms, navigation links) per key page. Test primary actions (search, reserve, book, confirm) and recovery actions (cancel, manage).`
- mobile: `Repeat critical checks (search, form interactions, navigation) on mobile viewport for all key pages (index, tokyo, hotel-detail, reservation, confirmation).`

## Planned Phases

### Home Page & Search Flow

- Objective: Validate the home page's search functionality, navigation, and responsive layout (desktop/mobile).
- Target pages: index.html
- Key checks:
  - Interact with the search bar (destination, dates, guests) and click 'Search' to ensure it navigates to tokyo.html. Test top navigation links (Stays, Flights, etc.) for responsiveness. Check mobile viewport for small tap targets and layout consistency.
- Exit criteria:
  - Successfully navigate from index.html to tokyo.html via search. Confirm all top navigation links are clickable and responsive. Mobile viewport shows no critical layout errors.

### City/Area Hotel Lists

- Objective: Test filtering, sorting, and navigation on tokyo.html (Tokyo list) and shinjuku.html (Shinjuku list).
- Target pages: tokyo.html, shinjuku.html
- Key checks:
  - Interact with filters (price, stars, amenities) and sorting options. Click a hotel card to navigate to hotel-detail.html. Test 'Show on map' and other list features. Repeat critical interactions in mobile viewport.
- Exit criteria:
  - Successfully filter/sort results and navigate to a hotel detail page. Confirm map and list features are functional. Mobile viewport filters/sorting work as expected.

### Hotel Detail & Room Selection

- Objective: Validate hotel detail page (hotel-detail.html) content, 'Reserve' flow, and room selection (room-selection.html).
- Target pages: hotel-detail.html, room-selection.html
- Key checks:
  - Review hotel details (location, amenities, reviews). Click 'Reserve' to proceed to room selection. Verify room details, price breakdown, and 'Continue to booking details' button. Check mobile viewport for responsive design.
- Exit criteria:
  - Successfully navigate from hotel-detail.html to room-selection.html. Confirm room details and price summary are accurate. Mobile viewport shows readable content and functional buttons.

### Booking & Confirmation

- Objective: Test the reservation form (reservation.html) and confirmation page (confirmation.html) for usability, validation, and accessibility.
- Target pages: reservation.html, confirmation.html
- Key checks:
  - Fill out reservation details (name, email, phone) and submit to reach confirmation.html. Verify confirmation page content (booking details, price, policies). Check form validation (e.g., required fields, email format). Test mobile viewport for form usability.
- Exit criteria:
  - Successfully submit reservation and reach confirmation.html. Confirm booking details are accurate. Mobile form interactions are smooth with proper validation.

### Adjacent Business Flows

- Objective: Sample adjacent flows (Flights, Car Rentals, Attractions) to assess consistency and usability.
- Target pages: flights.html, car-rentals.html, attractions.html
- Key checks:
  - Interact with search forms on each page (e.g., flight search, car rental search). Test primary actions (e.g., 'Search' for flights, 'View deal' for car rentals). Check responsive layout and mobile usability.
- Exit criteria:
  - Successfully complete a search action on each adjacent page. Confirm layout and functionality are consistent with the primary booking flow. Mobile viewport interactions are error-free.

### Recovery & Support Paths

- Objective: Test recovery paths (e.g., 'Cancel booking', 'Manage your trips') and support pages (help.html, my-trips.html).
- Target pages: my-trips.html, help.html, confirmation.html
- Key checks:
  - From confirmation.html, test 'Cancel booking' and 'Manage your booking' links. Navigate to my-trips.html to view bookings. Test help.html search and FAQ navigation. Check mobile responsiveness for support actions.
- Exit criteria:
  - Successfully navigate recovery paths (e.g., cancel a booking, manage trips). Confirm help page functionality (search, FAQ access). Mobile viewport support actions are usable.
