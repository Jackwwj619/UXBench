# OpsScope

OpsScope is a demo monitoring tool for engineering teams who run APIs and services in production. It gives you a single place to watch traffic, latency, and errors across every endpoint, and to triage incidents when something goes wrong.

> Fictional product — all numbers, alerts, and endpoints are sample data. Nothing connects to a real backend.

## What you can do

- **See the health of your whole API at a glance.** The overview shows total requests, error rate, p95 latency, and availability, with a grid of endpoint health cards that put problem endpoints first.
- **Drill into a single endpoint.** Open any endpoint to see its request volume, latency percentiles, error rate over time, sample failing requests, and the services it talks to.
- **Triage active alerts.** The alerts center lists what's firing, who owns it, and how long it's been open. You can assign alerts to teammates, silence noisy ones, or disable a rule.
- **Browse every endpoint.** The endpoints page gives you a searchable, filterable list of all 32 monitored endpoints.
- **Trace dependencies.** The services map shows how your services talk to each other; click a node to see all of that service's endpoints.

## How to use it

Open `index.html` in any modern browser — no install or server needed. Use the top bar to switch environments (Production / Staging / Dev) and time range (5 min, 1 hour, 24 hours, 7 days). Click any endpoint card to dive into its detail page, or jump straight to **Alerts**, **Endpoints**, or **Services** from the left rail. The bell icon shows active alerts wherever you are. There's a light/dark theme toggle in the top bar.

Destructive actions (silencing alerts, disabling rules) ask for confirmation before they go through.
