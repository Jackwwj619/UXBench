# Forge Coder

Forge Coder is a demo of an agentic coding IDE — the kind of tool where you describe a change in chat and an AI agent reads files, edits code, and runs your tests, while you watch the diff appear in real time. The example session shows the agent working on a TypeScript project called `atlas-cli`.

> Fictional product — the agent isn't really running. The file tree, chat steps, diffs, and test progress are all scripted.

## What you can do

- **See what the agent's doing right now.** The center column shows your conversation with the agent: your messages, its explanations, and a series of step cards (Reading file, Editing, Running tests) with timestamps. A pulsing "running" indicator and elapsed time live at the top.
- **Stop the agent mid-run.** Hit **Interrupt** in the run header to pause; a "paused" step card appears and the test ticker stops.
- **Browse the project.** The left file tree shows folders you can collapse and files marked **M** (modified) or **+** (newly added). Click any modified or new file to load its diff into the right pane.
- **Read the proposed changes.** The right pane shows a syntax-highlighted diff in either unified or split view. Type-check, lint, and test chips at the bottom show live progress — the test chip flips to **passing** when the run completes.
- **Send the agent a new instruction.** Use the composer at the bottom of the chat. Cmd/Ctrl+Enter submits. There's an **Auto-apply edits** toggle if you trust it to commit changes without asking.

## How to use it

Open `index.html` in any modern browser. Watch the example run play out, click around the file tree to see how diffs swap into the right pane, and try the Interrupt button to pause the session. Type a follow-up in the composer to see the chat extend with a new turn.
