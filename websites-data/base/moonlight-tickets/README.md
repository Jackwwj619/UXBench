# MoonlightTickets

MoonlightTickets is a demo ticketing platform for independent live music — the kind of site you'd use to find a show tonight, pick a tier (Early Bird / Standard / VIP), and check out under a countdown. The whole site is in a dark "after-dark" theme.

> Fictional product — events, venues, and the checkout flow are all illustrative; no tickets are actually sold.

## What you can do

- **Find a show.** The discovery page features four big "Tonight" cards across the top, filters for date, genre, venue, and price, and a 12-event grid for the rest of the week.
- **Read about an event.** Each event page has the show time and venue (with doors), a favorite/share row, artist bio with three audio clips, three ticket tier cards with -/+ steppers, a sticky right-hand order summary with fee preview, a venue layout sketch, accessibility notes, and related events. VIP carries a "SELLING FAST" badge.
- **Check out under pressure.** A 10-minute reservation countdown sits across the top of checkout (under a minute, it pulses red). Below: a collapsible cart, one accordion attendee form per ticket (VIP gets an extra "Name for signed poster" field, ticket 2+ can copy buyer info), three payment methods with card-number formatting, promo codes (try `DOORS5` or `TONIGHT10`), and a detailed fee breakdown on the right.
- **See your confirmation.** A large checkmark, an `MT-XXXXXXXX` order number, a fake QR per ticket with attendee name, and Apple Wallet / Google Wallet / Transfer buttons.

## How to use it

Open `index.html` in any modern browser. Browse the tonight cards or the week's grid, click into an event, pick your tier and quantity, then **Continue** through to checkout. The countdown is real — let it expire and you'll be sent back to the event page.
