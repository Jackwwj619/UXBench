# Harbor Wallet

Harbor Wallet is a demo iOS-style mobile wallet app — the kind of consumer wallet you'd use to check your balance, send money, receive payments, and view your transaction history. The layout simulates a phone (390 × 844) on a desktop, and goes edge-to-edge on a real phone.

> Fictional product — balances, contacts, and transactions are sample data. Nothing is sent or received.

## What you can do

- **Check your balance.** The home screen shows your USD balance with four quick actions (Send / Receive / Swap / Top up), your assets across USD, BTC, and ETH, and recent activity color-coded by direction (incoming, outgoing, card spend).
- **Send money.** Pick a wallet, type an amount on the on-screen dialpad, use quick chips ($20 / $50 / $100 / Max), or search for a recipient. The amount auto-formats as you type.
- **Receive money.** Switch between in-app, bank, and crypto using the segmented tabs. A QR code is drawn for you; the **Copy** button copies your `@milena.harlowe` handle.
- **Manage your account.** The profile screen shows your tier (Harbor Plus), seven settings rows, and a sign-out button.
- **Get notified.** The bell icon shows three unread notifications.

## How to use it

Open `index.html` in any modern browser. Use the bottom tab bar (Home / Send / Receive / Activity / Account) to move between screens. The dialpad on the Send screen builds the amount character by character — backspace removes a digit, **Max** fills your full balance. The status bar clock at the top updates as you watch.
