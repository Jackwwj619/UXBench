# CivicPort

CivicPort is a demo online permit portal for the fictional City of Avalon Bay. Residents and contractors use it to apply for a building permit, track open applications, and pay fees. It models a long, multi-section government form with branching steps and an estimated fee that updates as you fill things in.

## What you can do

- **Start at the portal home.** Three big buttons let you apply for a permit, track an existing application, or pay fees. A bulletin lists recent service announcements.
- **Apply for a permit.** A guided six-section form walks you through project details: address and parcel lookup, project type and scope, dates, ownership, contractor info, file uploads, neighbor signatures (when required), affidavits, and a final review before submitting. The step tree on the left shows where you are, marks completed steps with a check, and lets you jump back to revise.
- **See what materials you need, as you need them.** A panel on the right keeps a running checklist of documents required for your specific application, ticking items off as you fill them in.
- **See the fee as it adds up.** The estimated-fee breakdown updates whenever you change the project type, square footage, or extras. There's an expedited toggle that adds a surcharge.
- **Track past applications and look up fees.** *My applications* shows the status of your three sample applications; *Fees* explains the fee schedule by project type, plus how expedited processing works.

## How to use it

Open `index.html` in any modern browser. Click **Apply** to start the permit form. The form branches based on what you enter — choosing exterior changes adds a neighbor step, a historic parcel adds a historic-district step, and so on. Your progress is saved between visits in the same browser.
