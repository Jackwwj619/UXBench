# MeadowID

MeadowID is a demo identity dashboard — a single place to see what apps have access to your account, what devices are signed in, what factors you can use to log in, and how to export or freeze your data. It's the kind of "security center" most online accounts now ship.

> Fictional product — apps, sessions, and passkeys are sample data.

## What you can do

- **See your account at a glance.** The overview shows four tiles (connected apps, active sessions, passkeys, trust score), a list of issues to look at (unfamiliar session, weak factor, stale app), recent sign-ins, and a recovery-readiness checklist.
- **Audit connected apps.** Browse every third-party app that holds a token, with scope chips (sensitive ones highlighted). Filter and search the list, and revoke access — revoking asks for confirmation.
- **Manage active sessions.** A world map with pinned locations is linked one-to-one with a session list. Click a pin or row to see device details and end that session, or use **End all other sessions** to wipe everything except where you are.
- **Set up passkeys and 2FA.** Add or remove passkeys, manage backup factors (SMS is flagged risky, plus authenticator app and backup codes), and configure recovery contacts.
- **Export your data.** A four-step wizard walks you through picking categories, format and filters, schedule, and review. The final step asks for explicit confirmation before queuing the export.
- **Freeze your account.** A clear explanation of what freeze does and doesn't do, with a toggle that requires typing **FREEZE** before it takes effect. There's also a path to full deletion.

## How to use it

Open `index.html` in any modern browser. Use the sidebar to switch sections. Most destructive actions (revoking apps, ending sessions, freezing, deleting) require an extra confirmation step.
