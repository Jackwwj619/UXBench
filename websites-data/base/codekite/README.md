# CodeKite CI

CodeKite CI is a demo marketing site for a fictional cloud CI/CD service. The interesting part is the pricing-page calculator: pick how much you build, how many parallel jobs you need, and how much storage you use, and the page recommends a plan and breaks down what you'd pay.

> Fictional product — pricing and feature lists are illustrative.

## What you can do

- **Skim the pitch.** The home page has a short hero with a YAML example showing what a CodeKite pipeline looks like, three feature cards, and a button down to pricing.
- **Estimate what it would cost.** On the pricing page, the usage calculator has three sliders (build minutes, concurrency, storage) paired with number inputs — drag a slider or type a number, they stay in sync. Tick checkboxes for ARM, macOS, or GPU runners.
- **See your monthly total.** A sticky card on the right shows the running total, recommends a plan (Free / Team / Enterprise), and lists each line item so you can see why the number is what it is.
- **Compare plans in detail.** Below the calculator, a 16-row feature table compares everything across the three plans, with a 10-question FAQ below that.
- **Glance at the docs.** A placeholder quickstart shows what writing a pipeline file would look like.

## How to use it

Open `index.html` in any modern browser. Click through to `pricing.html` and play with the sliders — the right-hand quote and recommended plan update as you change usage. The Free plan covers a generous baseline; sliding past it shows the overage costs broken out by runner type.
