# ChatGPT Clone

A practice clone of the ChatGPT main chat interface, sign-in, sign-up, and pricing pages. You can type a message and get a reply, switch between past conversations, and walk through the marketing pages — all without an internet connection.

> Front-end demo only — there's no real model behind the chat. Replies are pre-written and chosen by matching keywords in what you type; "streaming" is a typewriter effect, not a real network stream. No API key needed.

## What you can do

- **Chat with the mock assistant.** Type in the box at the bottom and hit send. You'll see a streaming-style typewriter reply appear above. Try keywords like *Tokyo*, *email*, *quantum*, *debug*, *budget*, or *weekend trip* to see different pre-written answers.
- **Switch conversations.** The left sidebar lists recent chats; click any to swap context. Use **New chat** to start over.
- **Try the mock controls.** Copy, thumbs up, thumbs down, regenerate, voice input, and attachments all show a confirmation toast, but they don't actually do anything (deliberately — this is a UI demo).
- **Browse the marketing pages.** The sign-in, sign-up (multi-step), and pricing (Free / Plus / Pro / Business / Enterprise with feature comparison and FAQ) pages are all included.

## How to use it

Open `index.html` in any modern browser. Type a question and press Send — try mixing in one of the trigger keywords above to see the relevant pre-written reply. Use the sidebar to switch between sample conversations, or visit `login.html`, `signup.html`, or `pricing.html` for the surrounding flows.
