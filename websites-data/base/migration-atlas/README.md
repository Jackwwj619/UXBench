# Migration Atlas

Migration Atlas is a demo data explorer for animal-migration tracking — the kind of map you'd open to see where seven different species have been over the course of a year, scrub through the months, and click into individual animals to read their tag metadata.

> Fictional product — species, tracks, and tag data are all synthetic.

## What you can do

- **Watch animals move across a world map.** The center map shows where seven species are at the currently selected time. Each species has a per-individual track over 12 monthly waypoints.
- **Filter what you see.** Toggle individual species on or off (each shows its sample size). Choose a study year. Toggle on or off the trail line, monthly position dots, and stop-over polygons.
- **Scrub through the year.** The player below the map has a January→December slider, play/pause, and a speed selector. As you advance, trails extend behind each individual.
- **Inspect any individual.** Click a trail or pin to load that animal into the right rail: ID, age class, sex, logger version, tag deployment date, current position, and last-fix accuracy. Aggregate stats stay in a smaller panel beside it.

## How to use it

Open `index.html` in any modern browser. Pick which species to show in the left rail, hit **Play** to animate the year, or drag the slider to a specific month. Click any individual on the map to load its detail card on the right.
