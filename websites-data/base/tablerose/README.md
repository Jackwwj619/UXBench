# Tablerose

Tablerose is a demo restaurant reservation platform — the kind of site you'd use to discover restaurants, pick a time, and book a table. The booking flow runs across six pages, with your reservation carrying through each step.

> Fictional product — restaurants, time slots, and the card hold are illustrative.

## What you can do

- **Search for a table.** The discovery page has a five-field search card (city autocomplete, party size, date, time), five quick-pill suggestions, six trending restaurants, four editor guides, and a three-step "how it works."
- **Browse results.** Ten restaurants per page with photo, name, stars, blurb, tags, and per-row time slots (slots within ±30 min of your search are highlighted; others are muted). Filter by cuisine, price, neighborhood, and features, and sort by relevance, rating, price, or distance.
- **Read a restaurant.** Each detail page has a split hero (photo and info with stars, dress code, and hours), four tabs (Overview, Menu, Photos, Reviews), a sticky right-hand booking card with date / party / time slots, and a mini-map of the location. Favorite by tapping the heart.
- **Enter guest details.** First/last/phone/email, six dietary checkboxes, a 240-character note, and an occasion picker. The summary card on the right shows the computed cancel-by time (90 minutes before).
- **"Hold" your reservation.** The card-hold banner shows the held amount ($50 × party). Pick a payment method (card, Apple Pay, Google Pay), and add cake, a rose, or prosecco from three add-ons. Add-ons update the summary live.
- **See your confirmation.** An animated check, a `TR-XXXXXX` reference code, three action cards (calendar / resend / modify), a "before you go" with your dietary notes pulled through, and three "you might also like" suggestions.

## How to use it

Open `index.html` in any modern browser. Search for a city to start. The whole flow — Discover → Results → Restaurant → Guest → Payment → Confirmation — carries your reservation between pages in this browser.
