# OrbitRide

OrbitRide is a demo intercity rideshare / bus booking flow — the kind of site you'd use to compare buses between two cities, pick a seat on a bus diagram, add luggage and extras, and "check out". The whole booking flow lives across seven pages, carrying your trip through each step.

> Fictional product — trips, carriers, payments, and the final confirmation are illustrative.

## What you can do

- **Search a route.** Pick from-city and to-city (with autocomplete), a date, and how many passengers. The landing page also shows three value props and six popular routes.
- **Browse trips.** Eight trip rows show carrier, departure and arrival times, duration, stops, amenities, seats left, and price. Filter by time of day, price slider, or amenities; jump days using the 7-day date carousel.
- **Pick your seats.** A bus seat-map lets you select seats up to the number of passengers, with priority and standard rows, occupied and selected states, and a price box on the side.
- **Add extras.** Luggage stepper for carry-on, checked, and oversized bags per passenger; three add-ons (insurance, priority boarding, SMS updates); sticky summary on the right.
- **Enter passenger details.** One card per passenger (last/first/DOB/student ID/email); passengers 2+ get a "Copy contact from passenger 1" button.
- **Pay.** Three payment methods (card with auto-formatting, PayLite, Apple-Pay-style), promo codes (try `STUDENT10`, `FIRSTRIDE`, `FAMILYPACK`), and a fee breakdown.
- **Confirm.** Booking reference `OR-XXXXXX`, a fake QR, ticket download, plus calendar, email, and manage-booking buttons.

## How to use it

Open `index.html` in any modern browser. Search a route to start, then follow the flow through routes → seats → extras → passengers → payment → confirmation. A 10-minute price-lock countdown runs in the background; let it expire and you'll be sent back to the routes page.
